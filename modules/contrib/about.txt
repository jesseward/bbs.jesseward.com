About me.... 

I am a music nut, a systems engineer, a developer, a father and husband. 

I am currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer at LinkedIn, based out of their Mountain View offices. Free time is spent with family, traveling, working on my github projects or constantly sampling new and old music.
